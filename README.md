G-Control: Gesture-Based PC Control


Overview:
G-Control is a Python-based project that enables users to control their PC using gestures. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it leverages popular libraries such as OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, Keras, Tkinter, and more to provide a seamless gesture-based interaction experience.

Features:
Gesture Recognition: Utilizes computer vision through OpenCV to recognize and interpret gestures in real-time.
PC Control: Empowers users to perform actions like mouse movement, clicks, and keyboard inputs using defined gestures.
Cross-Platform: Designed to work on various operating systems, ensuring flexibility for users.
Machine Learning Integration: Incorporates Keras for training and enhancing gesture recognition models for improved accuracy.
User Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, making it easy to configure and customize settings.
